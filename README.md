# IP TRACKER

## DESCRIPTION

This application shows the location of a given device within a certain degree of accuracy. It takes in a public IP address and uses APIs to retrieve the coordinates of the IP along with other information. It then uses the leaflet map API to display the location. If no IP is given, the application will take the current users public IP.
